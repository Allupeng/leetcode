# Testcase Example:  '[2,3,1,1,4]'
#
# You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are
# initially positioned at nums[0].
# 
# Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from
# index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i +
# j] where:
# 
# 
# 0 <= j <= nums[i] and
# i + j < n
# 
# 
# Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are
# generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1
# step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
# It's guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1].
